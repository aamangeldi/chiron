# Chiron

A monorepo for various development tools and utilities.

Each subproject should:
1. Have its own directory with `pyproject.toml`
2. Use the `src/` layout for proper packaging
3. Include a README.md with usage instructions
4. Be independently installable with `pip install -e ./project-name/`
